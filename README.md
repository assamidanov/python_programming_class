# Group Project: cannon.py
Python for Programmers -> CS2520

This week's group assignment involves refactoring and extending a previous project completed in class, with an emphasis on modular programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). You will work in a group of 2-4 students to modify the code, making it more adaptable and easily modifiable for various requirements or design preferences. The primary objective of this assignment is to create a well-organized and easily modifiable codebase utilizing structural, modular, and object-oriented programming techniques.

__Project Description:__
The Cannon Game project is a continuation of the project that we did in class. The assignment tasks are as follows:

1. Implement various types of projectiles. [JARISSE ESCUBIDO]
2. Develop several target types with different movement patterns. [VANISA SUADPRATHON]
3. Transform the cannon into a moving tank. [VAL DELEON]
4. Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon. [GEORGE FRANSIS]
5. Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other. [VAL DELEON]
+ *DISCLAIMER for 5*: If player gets hit by its own Shells, this will also invoke the losing screen.

To get started, create a fork of the original project and work collaboratively to refactor the codebase. Organize the code into clear, concise, and reusable functions and modules that can be easily combined and modified as needed. Ensure that the code adheres to best practices and coding conventions for easy comprehension.

Modular programming and OOP are important aspects of this assignment. Divide your code into separate, well-defined modules that perform specific tasks or represent specific components of your project. Each module should be self-contained and have a clear interface for interaction with other modules.

In addition to modular programming, apply OOP principles by creating classes that represent the various components of the Cannon Game, such as projectiles, targets, tanks, and bombs. Use inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to create a clear hierarchy of classes and promote code reusability and maintainability.

Throughout the assignment, you are expected to communicate effectively with your group members using Git as a version control system. Git will help you collaborate, track changes, and resolve conflicts that may arise during development. Publish your final project on a GitHub page, complete with all necessary documentation and a clear README file.
